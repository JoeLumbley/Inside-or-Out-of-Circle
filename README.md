# Inside or Out of Circle 🔵 

This app demonstrates the fundamental concept of hit detection using **squared distance math**. It features a dynamic circle rendered via **GDI**, where the circle changes color in real time based on the mouse pointer’s position relative to its radius.

Key features:

- 🎯 **Fast Hit Detection**: Uses squared Euclidean distance for efficient, flicker-free collision checks — ideal for high-frequency pointer interaction.
- 🖱️ **Interactive Feedback**: The circle turns blue when the pointer is inside, gray when outside, giving clear visual cues to learners.
- 🌀 **Responsive Design**: The circle stays perfectly centered in the client area, even during form resizing.
- 🧽 **Smooth Rendering**: Leverages double buffering and anti-aliasing for clean visuals and minimal flicker.
- 🔍 **Educational Tool**: Perfect for teaching spatial logic, distance calculations, and graphics programming in an intuitive, visual way.

This project is ideal for students, educators, or developers exploring **geometry-driven hit testing**, **GDI drawing techniques**, or **performance-friendly UI feedback**.
